# Evaluation Framework for Assessing LLM Responses without Ground Truth

## Abstract

Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) responses typically relies on comparing outputs against predefined ground truths. However, obtaining ground truth data can be challenging, resource-intensive, or infeasible for certain tasks. This paper presents a novel framework for assessing LLM responses without the necessity of ground truth references. The proposed framework categorizes tasks, defines evaluation criteria, and leverages automated grading systems to ensure reliability and consistency in assessments. Through comprehensive examples and detailed methodologies, this framework aims to streamline the evaluation process, reduce the burden on QA teams, and enhance the scalability of LLM deployment across various applications.

## Introduction

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized various domains, including text generation, translation, code synthesis, and more. Evaluating the performance of these models is crucial to ensure their reliability, accuracy, and efficiency. Traditional evaluation methods rely heavily on ground truth data, which may not always be available or practical to obtain. This paper introduces an innovative framework designed to evaluate LLM responses without relying on ground truth references, thereby addressing the limitations of existing methodologies.

## Background

In many applications, establishing a ground truth for every possible output of an LLM is impractical. For instance, in creative writing or personalized content generation, the range of acceptable outputs is vast and subjective. Additionally, generating ground truth data can be time-consuming and costly, especially for specialized or niche tasks. To mitigate these challenges, alternative evaluation strategies that do not depend on ground truths are essential.

## Framework Overview

### Task Categorization

The first step in the evaluation framework is to categorize the LLM task. This categorization helps in determining the appropriate evaluation criteria and the necessary inputs for the assessment. The tasks are categorized as follows:

- Text Summarization
- Conversation Threads
- Translation
- Rephrasing
- Classification
- Text Generation
- Extraction
- Information Retrieval
- Question Answering
- Code Generation
- Personalized Generation

### API Payload Specification

To facilitate the evaluation process, a standardized API payload is defined. This payload encapsulates all necessary information required for assessing the LLM response.

```json
{
    "source_text": "Source Text" [Optional],
    "llm_response": "LLM Response" [Required],
    "prompt": "Prompt or Instruction" [Optional],
    "task_type": "Text Summarization" [Optional]
}
```

#### Parameters:

- **source_text**: The original text from which the LLM response is generated. Optional for tasks where the source text is not available or required.
- **llm_response**: The response generated by the LLM. Required for all tasks.
- **prompt**: The prompt or instruction given to the LLM. Optional if task type is provided.
- **task_type**: The type of task that the LLM response is for. Optional if prompt is provided.

The table below categorizes the parameters based on task types:

| Task Type              | Required Input                                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Text Summarization     | Source Text, LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type   |
| Conversation Threads    | Source Text, LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type  |
| Translation            | Source Text, LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type   |
| Rephrasing            | Source Text, LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type   |
| Classification         | Source Text, LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type   |
| Text Generation        | LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type                |
| Extraction             | Source Text, LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type   |
| Information Retrieval   | Source Text, LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type  |
| Question Answering     | Source Text, LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type   |
| Code Generation        | LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type                |
| Personalized Generation | LLM Response, Prompt or Task Type               |

## Evaluation Workflow

The evaluation process is structured to ensure consistency and accuracy. The workflow is depicted in the flowchart below.

    F --> G[Retrieve Grading Outcomes and Compute the Median Value]
    G --> H[Output the Final Grading Result]
```

### Step-by-Step Description

1. **Acquire Input Data**: Collect the necessary inputs, including source text, LLM response, prompt, and task type.
2. **Determine Task Type or Prompt**: Check if the task type or prompt is provided.
3. **Prompt Classification**: If a prompt is detected, classify it to identify the task type.
4. **Determine Grading System**: Based on the task type, select the appropriate grading rubric.
5. **Construct Grading Prompt**: Formulate a grading prompt tailored to the specific task.
6. **Transmit to LLM Evaluator**: Send the grading prompt **and payload** to an LLM-based evaluator.
7. **Retrieve and Compute**: Obtain the grading outcomes and calculate the median score.
8. **Output Final Result**: Present the final grading result for further analysis or action.

## Discussion

The proposed evaluation framework addresses several key challenges in assessing LLM responses without ground truths. By categorizing tasks and defining specific evaluation criteria, the framework ensures a structured and consistent assessment process. Automated grading systems enhance efficiency, reducing the manual workload on QA teams. Furthermore, the flexibility to handle diverse tasks—from code generation to creative writing—demonstrates the framework's adaptability.

## Conclusion

Evaluating LLM responses without ground truths is feasible through a structured framework that categorizes tasks, defines clear evaluation criteria, and leverages automated grading systems. This approach not only reduces the dependency on ground truth data but also enhances the scalability and efficiency of LLM evaluations across various applications. Future implementations can further refine the grading criteria and integrate more sophisticated evaluation tools to enhance the framework's robustness.

## Future Work

- **Integration with Advanced NLP Tools**: Incorporate more advanced natural language processing tools to enhance the accuracy of evaluations.
- **Dynamic Rubric Adjustment**: Develop mechanisms for dynamic adjustment of rubrics based on feedback and evolving task requirements.
- **Scalability Enhancements**: Optimize the framework for large-scale deployments involving multiple LLM instances and diverse task types.
